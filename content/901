All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must follow applicable law. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is excluded from arbitration under paragraph 21.6. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. In some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Los Angeles, California, at your option. Instructions for initiating an arbitration are available at the JAMS website and toll-free number referenced above.</p>","21.05":"<p>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>","21.06":"<p>21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>","21.07":"<p>21.7 30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the \"Binding Arbitration,\" \"Location,\" and \"Class Action Waiver\" paragraphs above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: King.com Ltd Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julian’s STJ3140, Malta, Attn: King Legal.
