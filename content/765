people where a majority have limited or no access to vehicle financing. In fact, the continent has the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world. In 2019, Africa had fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales. The U.S. sold more than 17 million new cars that same year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Nigeria, owning a car is a luxury very few people can afford. It is a similar case across Africa where car owners often recycle used cars between themselves because of the difficulty of accessing new ones. <a href=\"https:\/\/moove.africa\/\">Moove<\/a>, an African mobility company with a fintech play, wants to change that and is raising $23 million in Series A to scale <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rapidly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the continent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was founded by<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ladidelano?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADcQ8FABjW5jO79MRu88xUjUK_mFd4LYxFc&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3Bkt9csYDZRM2gEus%2BEO0Mow%3D%3D\"> Ladi Delano<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ng.linkedin.com\/in\/jide-odunsi-44b9b666\">Jide Odunsi<\/a> in 2019. In an interview with TechCrunch, Delano said he and Odunsi, whilst trying to figure out the problems to solve in Nigeria after years of running successful businesses, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were left<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> startled by the figures highlighted above: Less than a million new cars sold in an entire continent and over 17 million in the U.S. alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;It became clear to us that people aren&#8217;t buying cars in Africa because there&#8217;s no access to finance. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you look anywhere else in the world, you have financing in most parts of the developed world when you try to buy a car<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&#8217;s that way in the UK, or Europe and the US. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s driving mobility drive and vehicle sales,&#8221; Delano said during the interview<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders saw it as a huge task to address this deficit and figured that deploying an asset financing model was the go-to approach. Moove says it is democratizing vehicle ownership by employing a revenue-based vehicle financing model. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this applies to only a subset of the driving population across the continent: mobility entrepreneurs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why mobility entrepreneurs instead of the overall populace? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano tells TechCrunch that inasmuch as Moove is changing how people have access to new cars in Africa, he wants the company to solve some of the unemployment problems facing the continent, even more so in Nigeria. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead of providing the service for individuals from all spheres of life who cannot guarantee a payback, why not target mobility entrepreneurs who would use the opportunity to work and, in turn, generate income to pay back.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobility entrepreneurs include drivers who work in the mobility space (car-hailing, ride-hailing, bus-hailing, among others). Although they make up a small part of Africans who need Moove&#8217;s services, Delano says the market for mobility entrepreneurs is enormous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove is Uber\u2019s exclusive car financing and vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company embeds its alternative credit-scoring technology, allowing access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite loans. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It provides loans to these drivers by selling them new vehicles and financing up to 95% of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within five days of sign up<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can choose to pay back their loans over 24, 36, or 48 months, using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Uber<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove&#8217;s loan repayment process is more suitable to drivers than what <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traditionally<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exists in the market<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nigerian banks, for instance, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are known<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to collect a 10-50% deposit from drivers; Moove says it charges 5%. The net effective annual interest rate also differs <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">significantly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nigerian banks charge between 20 to 25%; however<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Moove runs on an 8-13% rate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, when you consider the tenure of a vehicle financing loan, Nigerian banks rarely give a repayment duration of more than two years<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove&#8217;s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximum<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> duration is four years. In the long run, Delano says the company wants to extend the repayment duration to five years, a span with more parity to the West<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Moove is looking to add financing to other vehicle classes and types in the coming months, including buses and trucks<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D41mOqQDn3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/\">South Africa&#8217;s FlexClub adds $5M to seed round to scale its car subscription marketplace<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;South Africa&#8217;s FlexClub adds $5M to seed round to scale its car subscription marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/embed\/#?secret=D41mOqQDn3\" data-secret=\"D41mOqQDn3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Moove <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was founded<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019, it didn&#8217;t <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fully<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> launch until June 2020. In a full year of operation, Moove has scaled <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggressively<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With headquarters in the Netherlands, the company counts Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg as cities where it operates. Moove has over 19,000 drivers using its platform, while up to 13,000 are on its waitlist. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove-financed cars have also completed over 850,000 Uber trips, and Delano says the company has grown 60% month-on-month since last year<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove raised a $5.5 million seed round last year. The majority of the funding came from the founders and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, and a key partner at the company. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to its $23 million Series A, Moove also revealed that it raised $40 million in debt financing, bringing its total funding to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0$68.5 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital led the Series A round. Other investors like DCM, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, LocalGlobe, Tekton, FJ Labs, Palm Drive Capital, Roka Works, KAAF Investments, Class 5 Global, Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable, Verod, Kepple Africa Ventures, and one of Moove\u2019s existing lenders, Emso Asset Management, also joined the round. Moove&#8217;s investment is the first for many of its U.S. backers in this round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quickly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa,\u201d said the general partner at Speedinvest, Stefan Klestil. \u201cThe company\u2019s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> five percent of new cars <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are purchased<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with financing, compared to 92 percent in Europe.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano and Odunsi are British-born Nigerians educated at the London School of Economics, Oxford University, and MIT. Delano has always been an entrepreneur. Odunsi, on the other hand, was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and a management consultant at McKinsey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both reconnected years after (since parting ways in their teens) to run a venture studio called Grace Lake Partners and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0have subsequently built three non-tech successful businesses in Africa in the past decade<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moove is their first tech business, and Delano calls it the fastest-growing he has ever run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Series A funding will allow Moove to grow and expand into new markets. It gives the company ammunition to develop and launch new products and services<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0geared<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> towards gaining more share in a competitive market where Nigeria&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/18\/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform\/\">Autochek<\/a> and South Africa&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/\">FlexClub<\/a> are making significant strides<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano believes what gives Moove an edge over other companies is its trademark of getting drivers to access new cars instead of used ones. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also adds that the company is moving towards creating electric and hybrid vehicle fleets<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He cites helping mobility entrepreneurs who need to have fuel-efficient cars and climate change as reasons for creating this new product line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how will EVs be affordable for the average Uber driver in Africa? Delano argues that with Moove&#8217;s strong bargaining power with its OEM partners and the debt financing raised, Moove can buy new EV cars and resell them at a lower price to thousands of drivers. The aim is to ensure that at least 60% of the vehicles it finances are electric or hybrid in the coming years. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company is also trying to drive gender inclusion by increasing the number of female drivers using its platform to 50%<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One interesting bit in Moove&#8217;s imminent plans is creating wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make and accept payments.

at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.levistrauss.com\/\">Levi Strauss &amp; Co<\/a>.\r\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Across industries, businesses are now tech and data companies. The sooner they grasp and live that, the quicker they will meet their customer needs and expectations, create more business value and grow. It is increasingly important to reimagine business and use digital technologies to create new business processes, cultures, customer experiences and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>One of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It\u2019s not. To succeed, digital transformation inherently requires and relies on diversity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the result of human intelligence, enabled by its vast talents and also susceptible to its limitations.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it is imperative for organizations and teams to make diversity a priority and think about it beyond the traditional sense. For me, diversity centers around three key pillars.<\/p>\n<h2>People<\/h2>\n<p>People are the most important part of artificial intelligence; the fact is that humans create artificial intelligence. The diversity of people \u2014 the team of decision-makers in the creation of AI algorithms \u2014 must reflect the diversity of the general population.<\/p>\n<p>This goes beyond ensuring opportunities for women in AI and technology roles. In addition, it includes the full dimensions of gender, race, ethnicity, skill set, experience, geography, education, perspectives, interests and more. Why? When you have diverse teams reviewing and analyzing data to make decisions, you mitigate the chances of their own individual and uniquely human experiences, privileges and limitations blinding them to the experiences of others.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOne of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It\u2019s not. \t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Collectively, we have an opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to propel the future and do good. That begins with diverse teams of people who reflect the full diversity and rich perspectives of our world.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Diversity of skills, perspectives, experiences and geographies has played a key role in our digital transformation. At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., our growing strategy and AI team doesn\u2019t include solely data and machine learning scientists and engineers. We recently tapped employees from across the organization around the world and deliberately set out to train people with no previous experience in coding or statistics. We took people in retail operations, distribution centers and warehouses, and design and planning and put them through our first-ever machine learning bootcamp, building on their expert retail skills and supercharging them with coding and statistics.<\/p>\n<p>We did not limit the required backgrounds; we simply looked for people who were curious problem solvers, analytical by nature and persistent to look for various ways of approaching business issues. The combination of existing expert retail skills and added machine learning knowledge meant employees who graduated from the program now have meaningful new perspectives on top of their business value. This first-of-its-kind initiative in the retail industry helped us develop a talented and diverse bench of team members.<\/p>\n<h2>Data<\/h2>\n<p>AI and machine learning capabilities are only as good as the data put into the system. We often limit ourselves to thinking of data in terms of structured tables &#8212; numbers and figures &#8212; but data is anything that can be digitized.<\/p>\n<p>The digital images of the jeans and jackets our company has been producing for the past 168 years are data. The customer service conversations (recorded only with permissions) are data. The heatmaps from how people move in our stores are data. The reviews from our consumers are data. Today, everything that can be digitized becomes data. We need to broaden how we think of data and ensure we constantly feed all data into AI work.<\/p>\n<p>Most predictive models use data from the past to predict the future. But because the apparel industry is still in the nascent stages of digital, data and AI adoption, having past data to reference is often a common problem. In fashion, we\u2019re looking ahead to predict trends and demand for completely new products, which have no sales history. How do we do that?<\/p>\n<p>We use more data than ever before, for example, both images of the new products and a database of our products from past seasons. We then apply computer vision algorithms to detect similarity between past and new fashion products, which helps us predict demand for those new products. These applications provide much more accurate estimates than experience or intuition do, supplementing previous practices with data- and AI-powered predictions.<\/p>\n<p>At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., we also use digital images and 3D assets to simulate how clothes feel and even create new fashion. For example, we train neural networks to understand the nuances around various jean styles like tapered legs, whisker patterns and distressed looks, and detect the physical properties of the components that affect the drapes, folds and creases. We\u2019re then able to combine this with market data, where we can tailor our product collections to meet changing consumer needs and desires and focus on the inclusiveness of our brand across demographics. Furthermore, we use AI to create new styles of apparel while always retaining the creativity and innovation of our world-class designers.<\/p>\n<h2>Tools and techniques<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to people and data, we need to ensure diversity in the tools and techniques we use in the creation and production of algorithms. Some AI systems and products use classification techniques, which can perpetuate gender or racial bias.<\/p>\n<p>For example, classification techniques assume gender is binary and commonly assign people as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d based on physical appearance and stereotypical assumptions, meaning all other forms of gender identity are erased. That\u2019s a problem, and it\u2019s upon all of us working in this space, in any company or industry, to prevent bias and advance techniques in order to capture all the nuances and ranges in people\u2019s lives. For example, we can take race out of the data to try and render an algorithm race-blind while continuously safeguarding against bias.<\/p>\n<p>We are committed to diversity in our AI products and systems and, in striving for that, we use open-source tools. Open-source tools and libraries by their nature are more diverse because they are available to everyone around the world and people from all backgrounds and fields work to enhance and advance them, enriching with their experiences and thus limiting bias.<\/p>\n<p>An example of how we do this at Levi Strauss &amp; Company is with our U.S. Red Tab loyalty program. As fans set up their profiles, we don\u2019t ask them to pick a gender or allow the AI system to make assumptions. Instead, we ask them to pick their style preferences (Women, Men, Both or Don&#8217;t Know) in order to help our AI system build tailored shopping experiences and more personalized product recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Diversity of people, data, and techniques and tools is helping Levi Strauss &amp; Co. revolutionize its business and our entire industry, transforming manual to automated, analog to digital, and intuitive to predictive. We are also building on the legacy of our company\u2019s social values, which has stood for equality, democracy and inclusiveness for 168 years. Diversity in AI is one of the latest opportunities to continue this legacy and shape the future of fashion.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1G0KT8L67g\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/how-to-choose-and-deploy-industry-specific-ai-models\/\">How to choose and deploy industry-specific AI models<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to choose and deploy industry-specific AI models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/how-to-choose-and-deploy-industry-specific-ai-models\/embed\/#?secret=1G0KT8L67g\" data-secret=\"1G0KT8L67g\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have an opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to propel the future and do good.

a cloud-based platform for in-house legal teams, raises $17M NZD from Insight Partners"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">In-house legal teams play a critical role in companies, but a lot of them don\u2019t have the same kind of technology as their counterparts in sales or finance. Instead, they often rely on email, shared inboxes and spreadsheets. <a href=\"https:\/\/lawvu.com\/\">LawVu<\/a> gives them a cloud-based platform to share legal advice, documents, communicate with each other or external counsel and create reports for the rest of the company, including the C-suite. \u201cLawVu is to legal what Salesforce is to sales teams,\u201d co-founder and chief strategy officer Tim Boyne told TechCrunch in an email.<\/p>\n<p>The Tauranga, New Zealand-based company announced today that it has raised $17 million NZD (about $11.9 million USD) in Series A funding led by Insight Partners, the venture firm known for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insightpartners.com\/blog\/categories\/scale-up\/\">its ScaleUp program for growth-stage startups<\/a>, with participation from returning investor AirTree Ventures. Its previous funding was a seed round of about $1.8 million USD led by Shasta Ventures and AirTree, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.privateequitywire.co.uk\/2021\/05\/04\/299583\/legal-tech-startup-lawvu-closes-seed-round-led-shasta-and-airtree-ventures\">announced in May<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>LawVu was founded in 2015 by Boyne, who spent over a decade working in IT and operations at law firms, and Sam Kidd, a SaaS project management expert. Since LawVu was designed for distributed teams and remote workers, adoption increased dramatically in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. LawVu\u2019s annual recurring revenue tripled in 2020 and is continuing to grow. While it has users in 30 countries, about two-thirds of its recurring revenue now comes from the United States and Australia, with clients like Telstra, AMP, Linktree, Expedia, PwC and Instacart.<\/p>\n<p>The company plans to hire key leadership roles in the U.S. for its global go-to-market strategy and open U.S. offices as it continues developing LawVu\u2019s technology.<\/p>\n<p>LawVu is used by in-house legal teams ranging from one person to more than 300. Its fastest adoption is coming from teams of five to 500 legal professionals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2hx25LkLXE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/canadas-newest-unicorn-clio-raises-110m-at-a-1-6b-valuation-for-legal-tech\/\">Canada&#8217;s newest unicorn: Clio raises $110M at a $1.6B valuation for legal tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Canada&#8217;s newest unicorn: Clio raises $110M at a $1.6B valuation for legal tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/canadas-newest-unicorn-clio-raises-110m-at-a-1-6b-valuation-for-legal-tech\/embed\/#?secret=2hx25LkLXE\" data-secret=\"2hx25LkLXE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The startup serves in-house legal teams, instead of law firms, because \u201cin-house lawyers have very different incentives and objectives to their private practice peers. This creates a vastly different set of needs for in-house lawyers to be effective at their jobs, particularly on the technology front,\u201d Boyne said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>For example, private practice lawyers focus on specific projects, charging clients on time spent. In contrast, in-house lawyers have to balance \u201creactive work,\u201d or what their company asks for, and \u201cproactive work,\u201d or anticipating the business\u2019 needs and reducing risks.<\/p>\n<p>LawVu\u2019s cloud platform serves as a \u201clegal workspace\u201d that combines all the tech tools in-house legal teams need. For example, it lets them manage matter (or legal issues that can include advice requests, contract executions, M&amp;A transactions or litigation), contracts, documents, e-billing and outsourced work.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Rk06DRM9cL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/legl-gets-7m-to-help-law-firms-upgrade-to-digital-workflows\/\">Legl gets $7M to help law firms upgrade to digital workflows<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Legl gets $7M to help law firms upgrade to digital workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/legl-gets-7m-to-help-law-firms-upgrade-to-digital-workflows\/embed\/#?secret=Rk06DRM9cL\" data-secret=\"Rk06DRM9cL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>For in-house legal teams, LawVu&#8217;s analytics helps the rest of their company understand exactly what they do by providing metrics using data that is usually tucked away in email inboxes or a salesperson\u2019s files, Boyne said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLegal work is largely invisible. Unlike other industries, legal is at the very beginning of its data journey,\u201d Boyne said. He added, \u201cas lawyers migrate their work into our workspace, everything is able to be captured as data. For the first time, the legal function now has the ability to see demand, types of work, team capacity, future hiring needs, what law firms are performing well, even process areas to automate with other tools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to helping in-house legal teams become more productive, LawVu also helps them prove their value to decision makers. Boyne explained that legal teams are often overlooked because they are viewed as cost centers which do not directly add to a company\u2019s profit, and who come in at the end of a project or decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTypically as a business scales really fast, the legal team can be left behind with the capacity to only fight fires and no time to engage and add much needed strategic value. If you don\u2019t have the data to back up the value and work you are doing, it becomes very hard to get more resources when needed, be this tech or people,\u201d Boyne said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLawVu workspace allows them to streamline their service, have information at their fingertips, deliver outcomes quickly, measure and demonstrate value, all freeing them up to truly become a valued member of the business leadership team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller will join LawVu\u2019s board. In a statement, she said, \u201cLawVu\u2019s global growth speaks volumes to its future as a business and ability to provide high-value outcomes to legal teams.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/cybersecurity\/\">cybersecurity<\/a> startup that helps organizations secure their operations by monitoring the raw electric signals of critical industrial assets, has raised $8.1 million in Series B funding.<\/p>\n<p>Siga\u2019s SigaGuard says its technology, used by Israel\u2019s critical water facilities and the New York Power Authority, is unique in that rather than monitoring the operational network, it uses <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/machine-learning\/\">machine learning<\/a> and predictive analysis to &#8220;listen&#8221; to Level 0 signals. These are typically made up of components and sensors that receive electrical signals, rather than protocols or data packets that can be manipulated by hackers.<\/p>\n<p>By monitoring Level 0, which Siga describes as the &#8220;richest and most reliable level of process data within any operational environment,&#8221; the company can detect cyberattacks on the most critical and vulnerable physical assets of national infrastructures.

people where a majority have limited or no access to vehicle financing. In fact, the continent has the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world. In 2019, Africa had fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales. The U.S. sold more than 17 million new cars that same year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Nigeria, owning a car is a luxury very few people can afford. It is a similar case across Africa where car owners often recycle used cars between themselves because of the difficulty of accessing new ones. <a href=\"https:\/\/moove.africa\/\">Moove<\/a>, an African mobility company with a fintech play, wants to change that and is raising $23 million in Series A to scale <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rapidly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the continent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was founded by<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ladidelano?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADcQ8FABjW5jO79MRu88xUjUK_mFd4LYxFc&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_people%3Bkt9csYDZRM2gEus%2BEO0Mow%3D%3D\"> Ladi Delano<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ng.linkedin.com\/in\/jide-odunsi-44b9b666\">Jide Odunsi<\/a> in 2019. In an interview with TechCrunch, Delano said he and Odunsi, whilst trying to figure out the problems to solve in Nigeria after years of running successful businesses, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were left<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> startled by the figures highlighted above: Less than a million new cars sold in an entire continent and over 17 million in the U.S. alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;It became clear to us that people aren&#8217;t buying cars in Africa because there&#8217;s no access to finance. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you look anywhere else in the world, you have financing in most parts of the developed world when you try to buy a car<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&#8217;s that way in the UK, or Europe and the US. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s driving mobility drive and vehicle sales,&#8221; Delano said during the interview<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founders saw it as a huge task to address this deficit and figured that deploying an asset financing model was the go-to approach. Moove says it is democratizing vehicle ownership by employing a revenue-based vehicle financing model. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this applies to only a subset of the driving population across the continent: mobility entrepreneurs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why mobility entrepreneurs instead of the overall populace? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano tells TechCrunch that inasmuch as Moove is changing how people have access to new cars in Africa, he wants the company to solve some of the unemployment problems facing the continent, even more so in Nigeria. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead of providing the service for individuals from all spheres of life who cannot guarantee a payback, why not target mobility entrepreneurs who would use the opportunity to work and, in turn, generate income to pay back.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobility entrepreneurs include drivers who work in the mobility space (car-hailing, ride-hailing, bus-hailing, among others). Although they make up a small part of Africans who need Moove&#8217;s services, Delano says the market for mobility entrepreneurs is enormous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove is Uber\u2019s exclusive car financing and vehicle supply partner in sub-Saharan Africa<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company embeds its alternative credit-scoring technology, allowing access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite loans. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It provides loans to these drivers by selling them new vehicles and financing up to 95% of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchase<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within five days of sign up<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can choose to pay back their loans over 24, 36, or 48 months, using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Uber<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove&#8217;s loan repayment process is more suitable to drivers than what <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traditionally<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exists in the market<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nigerian banks, for instance, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are known<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to collect a 10-50% deposit from drivers; Moove says it charges 5%. The net effective annual interest rate also differs <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">significantly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Nigerian banks charge between 20 to 25%; however<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Moove runs on an 8-13% rate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, when you consider the tenure of a vehicle financing loan, Nigerian banks rarely give a repayment duration of more than two years<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove&#8217;s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximum<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> duration is four years. In the long run, Delano says the company wants to extend the repayment duration to five years, a span with more parity to the West<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Moove is looking to add financing to other vehicle classes and types in the coming months, including buses and trucks<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D41mOqQDn3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/\">South Africa&#8217;s FlexClub adds $5M to seed round to scale its car subscription marketplace<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;South Africa&#8217;s FlexClub adds $5M to seed round to scale its car subscription marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/embed\/#?secret=D41mOqQDn3\" data-secret=\"D41mOqQDn3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Moove <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was founded<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019, it didn&#8217;t <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fully<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> launch until June 2020. In a full year of operation, Moove has scaled <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggressively<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With headquarters in the Netherlands, the company counts Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg as cities where it operates. Moove has over 19,000 drivers using its platform, while up to 13,000 are on its waitlist. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove-financed cars have also completed over 850,000 Uber trips, and Delano says the company has grown 60% month-on-month since last year<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moove raised a $5.5 million seed round last year. The majority of the funding came from the founders and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave, and a key partner at the company. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to its $23 million Series A, Moove also revealed that it raised $40 million in debt financing, bringing its total funding to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0$68.5 million.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speedinvest and Left Lane Capital led the Series A round. Other investors like DCM, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, LocalGlobe, Tekton, FJ Labs, Palm Drive Capital, Roka Works, KAAF Investments, Class 5 Global, Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable, Verod, Kepple Africa Ventures, and one of Moove\u2019s existing lenders, Emso Asset Management, also joined the round. Moove&#8217;s investment is the first for many of its U.S. backers in this round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quickly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa,\u201d said the general partner at Speedinvest, Stefan Klestil. \u201cThe company\u2019s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> five percent of new cars <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are purchased<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with financing, compared to 92 percent in Europe.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano and Odunsi are British-born Nigerians educated at the London School of Economics, Oxford University, and MIT. Delano has always been an entrepreneur. Odunsi, on the other hand, was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and a management consultant at McKinsey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both reconnected years after (since parting ways in their teens) to run a venture studio called Grace Lake Partners and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0have subsequently built three non-tech successful businesses in Africa in the past decade<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moove is their first tech business, and Delano calls it the fastest-growing he has ever run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Series A funding will allow Moove to grow and expand into new markets. It gives the company ammunition to develop and launch new products and services<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0geared<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> towards gaining more share in a competitive market where Nigeria&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/18\/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform\/\">Autochek<\/a> and South Africa&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/11\/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace\/\">FlexClub<\/a> are making significant strides<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delano believes what gives Moove an edge over other companies is its trademark of getting drivers to access new cars instead of used ones. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also adds that the company is moving towards creating electric and hybrid vehicle fleets<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He cites helping mobility entrepreneurs who need to have fuel-efficient cars and climate change as reasons for creating this new product line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how will EVs be affordable for the average Uber driver in Africa? Delano argues that with Moove&#8217;s strong bargaining power with its OEM partners and the debt financing raised, Moove can buy new EV cars and resell them at a lower price to thousands of drivers. The aim is to ensure that at least 60% of the vehicles it finances are electric or hybrid in the coming years. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company is also trying to drive gender inclusion by increasing the number of female drivers using its platform to 50%<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One interesting bit in Moove&#8217;s imminent plans is creating wallets for drivers who do not have bank accounts to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make and accept payments. The feature is live only in Ghana but will be coming to other markets in no distant time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMoove\u2019s technology is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fundamentally<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> changing access to mobility and empowering thousands to earn a new source of income,\u201d said managing partner at Left Lane Capital, Dan Ahrens. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs we look ahead, the potential for that technology and the Moove team to expand even further is very exciting<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The company recently surveyed current users, asking about the top five asset classes they invest in. Crypto came in third after mutual funds and digital gold, and before stocks at number four.<\/p>\n<p>The preference for crypto over stocks is echoed in figures <a href=\"https:\/\/kr-asia.com\/over-6-5-million-indonesians-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-first-5-months-of-2021-ministry-of-trade-says\">released by the Indonesian Ministry of Trade<\/a>, which showed that as of June 2021, there were over 6.5 million crypto investors in Indonesia, or about triple the 2.2 million public equity investors in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Pintu is a licensed crypto broker under the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI). It has a low minimum investment rate of 11,000 IDR, or about 75 cents USD, making it more attractive to new investors.<\/p>\n<p>Timothius Martin, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, was a first-time investor when he started using Pintu. He told TechCrunch that the number one draw was accessibility. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to start investing and also withdraw assets. In Indonesia, we are now at a stage where people have heard about crypto, about Bitcoin, are very interested and may already want to invest, but there are not many options that are easy enough for them to understand.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead of encouraging users to make an investment when they open the app for the first time, Pintu presents them with educational materials. For example, one of its features is Pintu Academy, a collection of articles and videos. While Pintu\u2019s target demographic is millennials, it\u2019s also attracting older demographics, including people who have traded other assets, like stocks, but want to learn more about the fundamentals of crypto trading.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Hk8cFBZHGq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m\/\">Bibit raises another growth round led by Sequoia Capital India, this time for $65M<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Bibit raises another growth round led by Sequoia Capital India, this time for $65M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/bibit-raises-another-growth-round-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-this-time-for-65m\/embed\/#?secret=Hk8cFBZHGq\" data-secret=\"Hk8cFBZHGq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Adjiputro said Pintu\u2019s focus on education is what differentiates it from other Indonesian crypto platforms like Indodax and Tokocrypto.<\/p>\n<p>The company is getting ready to launch new features, like Pintu Earn, a crypto asset account that lets users earn interest on a variety of crypto assets, and e-wallet integration for easier deposits and withdrawals.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also deciding what coins to add next. \u201cWe\u2019re very selective in terms of the coins we introduce, because this is a platform for first-time investors and beginners, so we want to protect them, not only in terms of our UI, but also the selection of coins we have,\u201d Martin said.<\/p>\n<p>Pintu\u2019s criteria for new coins include ones that have a high market cap, meaning adoption is already relatively mainstream.

The pandemic blasted Zoom into the product-name-as-a-verb hall of fame pretty much overnight, with &#8220;let\u2019s Zoom next week&#8221; joining the ranks of &#8220;Xerox this for me?&#8221; or &#8220;Photoshop it&#8221; or &#8220;Google it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With rapid growth, of course, comes growing pains.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Among these pains was a significant uptick in trolling. The idea of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/17\/zoombombing\/\">Zoombombing<\/a>&#8221; was born, wherein unapproved attendees crash a Zoom call and flood it with nasty images, hate speech, and whatever else they can blast out before the moderator (often unfamiliar with Zoom&#8217;s interface) figures out how to lock it down.<\/p>\n<p>By April of 2020, Zoom had tweaked its settings to make meetings a bit less zoombomb-able by default \u2014 but by that point, a lawsuit had already been filed. <em>Fourteen<\/em> lawsuits were filed, in fact, and later condensed into one. The suits argued that the company hadn&#8217;t done enough to prevent Zoombombing, as well as shared user data with third parties without the user&#8217;s permission.<\/p>\n<p>This week Zoom agreed to an $85 million settlement, along with a promise to add even more safeguards against would-be crashers. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how massive\/sudden popularity can cause all new problems \u2026 but, well, considering that Zoom&#8217;s market cap went from $34 billion in March 2020 to $118 billion as of this week, I doubt anyone there is too crushed about it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qvD4mBH00s\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/17\/zoombombing\/\">Beware of &#8216;ZoomBombing&#8217;: screensharing filth to video calls<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Beware of &#8216;ZoomBombing&#8217;: screensharing filth to video calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/17\/zoombombing\/embed\/#?secret=qvD4mBH00s\" data-secret=\"qvD4mBH00s\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Other Things<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/02\/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6\/\"><strong>Google previews the Pixel 6<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s next flagship Android phone is coming! When? TBD. How much? Good question! The company held back an unusual number of details in its first official acknowledgement of the Pixel 6&#8217;s existence, presumably to keep the focus on the custom AI-centric system on a chip they&#8217;re building for it. We know it&#8217;s got a big ol&#8217; camera bump (or &#8220;camera bar,&#8221; as they&#8217;re calling it) and there will be two models (Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro).

This week they started rolling those changes back as a &#8220;test&#8221;&#8230; and, well, people are mad. The company presumably has some data-driven reasons to revert&#8230; but from the outside, with the pandemic still ongoing, it just looks like a bad decision. <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Niantic has responded to the community uproar by forming an internal team to examine the options, promising updates by September 1st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/whatsapp-view-once-disappearing-photos-video\/\"><strong>WhatsApp gets self-destructing, single-view photos<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This week, WhatsApp embraced its inner-Snapchat with the introduction of &#8220;view once&#8221; mode, which allows users to send photos and videos that can be viewed once before they self-destruct.

at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.levistrauss.com\/\">Levi Strauss &amp; Co<\/a>.\r\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Across industries, businesses are now tech and data companies. The sooner they grasp and live that, the quicker they will meet their customer needs and expectations, create more business value and grow. It is increasingly important to reimagine business and use digital technologies to create new business processes, cultures, customer experiences and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>One of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It\u2019s not. To succeed, digital transformation inherently requires and relies on diversity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the result of human intelligence, enabled by its vast talents and also susceptible to its limitations.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it is imperative for organizations and teams to make diversity a priority and think about it beyond the traditional sense. For me, diversity centers around three key pillars.<\/p>\n<h2>People<\/h2>\n<p>People are the most important part of artificial intelligence; the fact is that humans create artificial intelligence. The diversity of people \u2014 the team of decision-makers in the creation of AI algorithms \u2014 must reflect the diversity of the general population.<\/p>\n<p>This goes beyond ensuring opportunities for women in AI and technology roles. In addition, it includes the full dimensions of gender, race, ethnicity, skill set, experience, geography, education, perspectives, interests and more. Why? When you have diverse teams reviewing and analyzing data to make decisions, you mitigate the chances of their own individual and uniquely human experiences, privileges and limitations blinding them to the experiences of others.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOne of the myths about digital transformation is that it&#8217;s all about harnessing technology. It\u2019s not. \t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Collectively, we have an opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to propel the future and do good. That begins with diverse teams of people who reflect the full diversity and rich perspectives of our world.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Diversity of skills, perspectives, experiences and geographies has played a key role in our digital transformation. At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., our growing strategy and AI team doesn\u2019t include solely data and machine learning scientists and engineers. We recently tapped employees from across the organization around the world and deliberately set out to train people with no previous experience in coding or statistics. We took people in retail operations, distribution centers and warehouses, and design and planning and put them through our first-ever machine learning bootcamp, building on their expert retail skills and supercharging them with coding and statistics.<\/p>\n<p>We did not limit the required backgrounds; we simply looked for people who were curious problem solvers, analytical by nature and persistent to look for various ways of approaching business issues. The combination of existing expert retail skills and added machine learning knowledge meant employees who graduated from the program now have meaningful new perspectives on top of their business value. This first-of-its-kind initiative in the retail industry helped us develop a talented and diverse bench of team members.<\/p>\n<h2>Data<\/h2>\n<p>AI and machine learning capabilities are only as good as the data put into the system. We often limit ourselves to thinking of data in terms of structured tables &#8212; numbers and figures &#8212; but data is anything that can be digitized.<\/p>\n<p>The digital images of the jeans and jackets our company has been producing for the past 168 years are data. The customer service conversations (recorded only with permissions) are data. The heatmaps from how people move in our stores are data. The reviews from our consumers are data. Today, everything that can be digitized becomes data. We need to broaden how we think of data and ensure we constantly feed all data into AI work.<\/p>\n<p>Most predictive models use data from the past to predict the future. But because the apparel industry is still in the nascent stages of digital, data and AI adoption, having past data to reference is often a common problem. In fashion, we\u2019re looking ahead to predict trends and demand for completely new products, which have no sales history. How do we do that?<\/p>\n<p>We use more data than ever before, for example, both images of the new products and a database of our products from past seasons. We then apply computer vision algorithms to detect similarity between past and new fashion products, which helps us predict demand for those new products. These applications provide much more accurate estimates than experience or intuition do, supplementing previous practices with data- and AI-powered predictions.<\/p>\n<p>At Levi Strauss &amp; Co., we also use digital images and 3D assets to simulate how clothes feel and even create new fashion. For example, we train neural networks to understand the nuances around various jean styles like tapered legs, whisker patterns and distressed looks, and detect the physical properties of the components that affect the drapes, folds and creases. We\u2019re then able to combine this with market data, where we can tailor our product collections to meet changing consumer needs and desires and focus on the inclusiveness of our brand across demographics. Furthermore, we use AI to create new styles of apparel while always retaining the creativity and innovation of our world-class designers.<\/p>\n<h2>Tools and techniques<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to people and data, we need to ensure diversity in the tools and techniques we use in the creation and production of algorithms. Some AI systems and products use classification techniques, which can perpetuate gender or racial bias.<\/p>\n<p>For example, classification techniques assume gender is binary and commonly assign people as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d based on physical appearance and stereotypical assumptions, meaning all other forms of gender identity are erased. That\u2019s a problem, and it\u2019s upon all of us working in this space, in any company or industry, to prevent bias and advance techniques in order to capture all the nuances and ranges in people\u2019s lives. For example, we can take race out of the data to try and render an algorithm race-blind while continuously safeguarding against bias.<\/p>\n<p>We are committed to diversity in our AI products and systems and, in striving for that, we use open-source tools. Open-source tools and libraries by their nature are more diverse because they are available to everyone around the world and people from all backgrounds and fields work to enhance and advance them, enriching with their experiences and thus limiting bias.<\/p>\n<p>An example of how we do this at Levi Strauss &amp; Company is with our U.S. Red Tab loyalty program. As fans set up their profiles, we don\u2019t ask them to pick a gender or allow the AI system to make assumptions. Instead, we ask them to pick their style preferences (Women, Men, Both or Don&#8217;t Know) in order to help our AI system build tailored shopping experiences and more personalized product recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Diversity of people, data, and techniques and tools is helping Levi Strauss &amp; Co. revolutionize its business and our entire industry, transforming manual to automated, analog to digital, and intuitive to predictive. We are also building on the legacy of our company\u2019s social values, which has stood for equality, democracy and inclusiveness for 168 years. Diversity in AI is one of the latest opportunities to continue this legacy and shape the future of fashion.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1G0KT8L67g\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/how-to-choose-and-deploy-industry-specific-ai-models\/\">How to choose and deploy industry-specific AI models<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to choose and deploy industry-specific AI models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/how-to-choose-and-deploy-industry-specific-ai-models\/embed\/#?secret=1G0KT8L67g\" data-secret=\"1G0KT8L67g\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have an opportunity to apply AI and machine learning to propel the future and do good.

The company on Thursday announced a new set of features, arriving later this year, that will detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in its cloud and report it to law enforcement. Companies like Dropbox, Google and Microsoft already scan for CSAM in their cloud services, but Apple had allowed users to encrypt their data before it reached iCloud. Now, Apple&#8217;s new technology, NeuralHash, will run on users&#8217; devices, tatformso detect when a users upload known CSAM imagery &#8212; without having to first decrypt the images.

The TikTok Stories appear in a left-hand sidebar and allow users to post ephemeral images or video that disappear in 24 hours.

(An Android <a href=\"https:\/\/modgameapk.net\/xingtu-%E9%86%92-%E5%9B%BE-apk\/\">version<\/a> is also available.) The app offers advanced editing tools that let users edit their face and body, like FaceTune, apply makeup, add filters and more. While image-editing apps can be controversial for how they can impact body acceptance, Xingtu offers a variety of artistic filters which is what&#8217;s primarily driving the demand. It&#8217;s interesting to see the lengths people will go to just to get a few new filters for their photos &#8212; perhaps making a case for Instagram to finally update its Post filters instead of pretending no one cares about their static photos anymore.<\/p>\n<h1>Tweets<\/h1>\n<p><em>Facebook still dominating top charts, but not the No. 1 spot:\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The most downloaded app worldwide for July 2021 was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tiktok_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tiktok_us<\/a> with more than 63M installs. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@instagram<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/messenger?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@messenger<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WhatsApp<\/a> rounded out the top 5: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/H9RMR5Pg9P\">https:\/\/t.co\/H9RMR5Pg9P<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/tiktok?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tiktok<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/topapps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#topapps<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/mobileapps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mobileapps<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/mobilegrowth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mobilegrowth<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/srlDI07FeD\">pic.twitter.com\/srlDI07FeD<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Sensor Tower (@SensorTower) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SensorTower\/status\/1423380936830472200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p><em>Not cool, Apple:\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Apple promoting these slime apps again.<\/p>\n<p>A few of them have $10+ weekly subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p>One of them doesn\u2019t even do anything.<a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/d0dKLCkiVF\">https:\/\/t.co\/d0dKLCkiVF<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Beau Nouvelle (@BeauNouvelle) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BeauNouvelle\/status\/1422941988349825027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 4, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p><em>This user acquisition strategy:\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great feedback, wanna use\/test <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FlightyApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FlightyApp<\/a>?

Want the weekly digest in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p>I spoke to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pickavet\">my editor<\/a> this week about the usual: upcoming stories, the future of the podcast and the existential dread of imposter syndrome amid a year-and-a-half of extreme change. The last bit took up the majority of the conversation. Go figure!<\/p>\n<p>Our conversation was helpful because it put words to stresses that often sit in between the lines and gave weight to small things that get hidden during a pandemic-sized year. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bore you with my thought loops, but I will extract a few lessons that I think are broadly applicable to Startups Weekly readers, because based on your clicks, I know you\u2019re into tips (and earnest ones, at that):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Give yourself grace.<\/strong> The pandemic has been confusing, imbalanced and brought a lot of loss to a lot of people. If you feel like you\u2019re operating at anything less than 100% right now, remember that you are operating during a time when the world feels like it\u2019s depending on a frayed lightbulb for guidance. Before you are hard on yourself for not being productive, think about where your productivity standards are coming from, and if they are even fair in the first place.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your problems are not unique.<\/strong> While we all are diverse, nuanced individuals, we aren\u2019t alone in a lot of what makes us human. Everyone overthinks, everyone soul searches, everyone has personal and professional insecurities that bubble up in non-obvious ways. By believing that your problems are not entirely unique, I think you\u2019ll find yourself feeling more in control of turbulence. Which brings me to my next point \u2026<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability is everything. <\/strong>Vulnerability was front and center in the first inning of the pandemic, where we were all brought into each other&#8217;s living rooms and home offices and backyards through Zoom. That vibe has somewhat faded as we\u2019ve adapted more and more to distributed work, but it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t try to find ways to be more vulnerable with each other. Let yourself have a voice, even in moments where it\u2019s easier to stay quiet, because you will feel closer at the end of it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Take what you will from the above advice (or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/10-ways-founders-can-manage-their-mental-health-while-fundraising\/\">see these tips<\/a> from a fellow entrepreneur), but I think it all boils down to a belief that we should be humans first, and <em>insert job role here<\/em> second. It\u2019s truly (still) an unprecedented time in this world, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/ending-the-mental-health-stigma-in-the-tech-community\/\">ending mental health stigma<\/a> in general is a worthwhile goal.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of this newsletter is about a cyberattack on a VC firm, AfterSquare, and an EC-1 about 911.

Sign up <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Q2 earnings cycle is powering along, which means that your humble Exchange crew have been on the phone with a number of public-company CEOs working to bring you the trends and notes that matter. To that end, today we\u2019re going to check in on Appian, Paycom and BigCommerce.<\/p>\n<p>After that we\u2019ll peek at fresh material that will bolster our recent dives <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/02\/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay\/\">into the BNPL world<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/05\/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns\/\">startup competition<\/a>. So, a grab bag today, and hopefully one full of goodies!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with <strong>Appian<\/strong>. I got to know the company midpandemic when a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/27\/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps\/\">host of companies were hammering away<\/a>, building apps using its low-code tech. At the time Appian was worth about half of what it is today. (You can read the company\u2019s Q2 report <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.appian.com\/index.php\/static-files\/e2b1dbd4-a4c7-4987-af1d-20b97cef253f\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Since then the company has continued its cloud push, slowing shedding services revenues in favor of high-margin SaaS incomes. It\u2019s not the only company executing a related transformation. But for our purposes today I want to talk about what comes after the basic low-code work that we spent much of 2020 digging into.<\/p>\n<p>Appian announced that it is buying process mining firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/lana-labs\">Lana Labs<\/a> in conjunction with its second-quarter earnings. What\u2019s process mining? Thanks for asking. Process mining is a software technique for finding processes inside of companies that <em>can<\/em> be automated. It\u2019s all well and good to buy an RPA service for your company, but if you don\u2019t know what you can automate, you might not wind up getting full value.<\/p>\n<p>All this matters in the case of Appian as the company now has process mining, RPA and low-code tooling to help companies create applications under a single roof. In practice the parts work together with process mining identifying things to automate, a workflow that is then taken up by RPA and other forms of automation &#8212; AI, human &#8212; to allow companies to better get their operations in efficient order.<\/p>\n<p>I asked Appian CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mattcalkins\/\">Matt Calkins<\/a> about the difference between workflows and apps. He said that they are pretty much the same thing. This makes the low-code world a bit more grokable. How many apps could corporations really need, I\u2019ve always wondered. The same question regarding how many workflows that companies may need to automate feels different. It feels like there\u2019s many, many more possibilities. So, a bigger TAM.<\/p>\n<p>Updating my thinking about low-code, this dynamic makes me more bullish on the software method if it\u2019s more in service of helping companies digitize their operations and automate rote tasks than simply building more apps.<\/p>\n<p>Turning the page to <strong>BigCommerce<\/strong>, the open-SaaS e-commerce platform has had a good few quarters, posting generally accelerating revenue growth despite Shopify\u2019s rising global profile. It also just marked its first anniversary <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/after-shopifys-huge-quarter-bigcommerce-raises-its-ipo-price-range\/\">since going public<\/a>, so I spent a few minutes with CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brent-bellm-3b305214\/\">Brent Bellm<\/a> to chat about what he\u2019s learned in that year, and if going public was worth it. (You can read the company\u2019s Q2 report <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.bigcommerce.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/bigcommerce-announces-second-quarter-financial-results-0\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>It was, he said. He made two cases for taking companies public that I wanted to share. They add up to faster growth at BigCommerce, though Bellm cautioned that it was impossible to disaggregate growth stemming from the following factors from other elements that contributed to his company\u2019s recent performance.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, a few reasons to go public:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credibility: <\/strong>Being a public company with open finances can breed in-market confidence. Startups have an awkward habit of dying somewhat often. Public companies far less so. This means that customers are more likely to trust a company, perhaps boosting its chances of securing deals. Even more, partners are more confident in BigCommerce now that it is public, per Bellm, helping drive more partnerships and growth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Increased attention:<\/strong> I thought that I understood this element of going public, but Bellm expanded my perspective. Of <em>course<\/em> going public is a branding event. But that\u2019s where I thought this particular edge wrapped up. Instead, the CEO explained that now when his company does <em>a thing<\/em> the analyst community has to pay attention, for example. So it\u2019s easier for BigCommerce to stay in the public eye as a public company than when it was a startup. Call it boosted ambient market noise, in a good sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bellm told The Exchange that going public was \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d for his company. Unicorns, take note.<\/p>\n<p>Then there was <strong>Paycom<\/strong>. This chat was mostly about talent in two ways. First, Paycom is dealing with the same competitive tech talent market as every other company. But notably it\u2019s seeing a tight supply of the talent it needs despite being far from traditional technology hubs. Paycom is based in Oklahoma, notably. (You can read the company\u2019s Q2 report <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.paycom.com\/press-releases\/press-release-details\/2021\/Paycom-Software-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results\/default.aspx\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>But the talent market and its general tightness today is impacting Paycom in another way: The HR-tech company sells software that helps companies secure and retain talent. Those businesses, per the company\u2019s CEO Chad Richison, are benefiting from companies\u2019 putting more focus on not letting talent go after they went through all the work of getting them aboard.<\/p>\n<p>Also the labor market has become very similar to the venture capital market, it turns out. Richison said that today you have to make a choice on whether to hire someone after you interview them within a few days. Before you had more time. Just like VCs today are forced to cut checks in days instead of weeks and months.<\/p>\n<p>Hot economy summer, or something.<\/p>\n<h2>The startup BNPL market<\/h2>\n<p>Hope remains for the startup BNPL market, per <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ozdane\">Brad Paterson<\/a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.splitit.com\/\">Splitit<\/a>. Splitit allows customers to use their current credit cards to make installment payments. So it\u2019s a mix of traditional credit and BNPL. (SplitIt\u2019s Crunchbase page is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/payitsimple\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Paterson volunteered to provide comment on the current market for BNPL startups, and after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/what-squares-acquisition-of-afterpay-means-for-startups\/\">chatting much about the Square-Afterpay deal<\/a>, I wanted to get his take on why smaller companies are going to be able to survive behemoths charging into their market.<\/p>\n<p>In an email, Paterson argued that a wealth of factors, what he described as \u201caverage purchase price, length of installment plan, industry vertical serviced, etc.\u201d will protect margins in the space. And that as BNPL solutions can \u201cextend beyond smaller purchases,\u201d there will be room for startups in the space.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the better question is how much more work there is to do with consumer credit and checkout. That sounds much more like an infinite problem space than just BNPL tooling itself.<\/p>\n<h2>Startup competition<\/h2>\n<p>Returning to our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/05\/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns\/\">earlier work regarding startup competition<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dunkhippo33\">Elizabeth Yin<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HustleFundVC\">Hustle Fund<\/a> sent in a list of notes that I want to share. When we were discussing the importance of being a leading player in markets for startups, we were mostly discussing the marketplace space, areas where young companies are trying to connect different parties.<\/p>\n<p>In ride-hailing, that\u2019s drivers and riders. Food delivery is even more complex, with delivery drivers, consumers and food-generative business establishments. You get the idea. Per Yin, being content with lower-tier market share is \u201cgenerally really tough.\u201d She continued:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The value of a marketplace usually increases as both the supply and demand sides increase. E.g., more listings + customers on Airbnb. More drivers and riders on Uber. Etc. In fact, in many cases, that is the <em>sole<\/em> value.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re No. 3 or No. 4 in the market, retention is a big potential concern, because you have to ask yourself what will enable you to keep your supply and demand sides from defecting to the No. 1 or No. 2 player that has a larger network? This is why you tend to see consolidation of marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>For early backers, they may still end up doing fine via an acquisition to No. 1 or No. 2, but it may end up being a magnitude or two off from the outcome of backing the No. 1 or No. 2 marketplace. For this reason, if there are already a couple of marketplaces that have a strong head start, early-stage investors tend to shy away from backing a new player.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yin also answered our question \u200b\u200bstartup marketplace competition generally yielding markets with a small number of leading players, and a dearth of other competitors as smaller entrants are chased out due to low market share. She added an interesting perspective regarding the impact of capital:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In general, yes, but investors also play a role in this phenomenon. Once a couple of companies get going, investors tend to pour more into those initial leaders AND others tend to shy away from backing competitors. And once money floods a space, it&#8217;s really customer acquisition costs that become an issue &#8212; CAC gets driven up by the top companies. (We saw this with the rise in food delivery companies). This is why you can&#8217;t really bootstrap a marketplace company very easily &#8212; you can&#8217;t afford to acquire customers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is, in a sense, an answer to the question about kingmaking in the startup world. VCs are not deciding who wins in many cases, but the impact of capital really can skew results in the marketplace world. Now, let\u2019s stop before we start endorsing how the first Vision Fund disbursed capital! \ud83d\ude02<\/p>\n<p>Hugs, and get vaccinated.<\/p>\n<p>Your friend,<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574370,"featured_media":2009129,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"e413cb59-4ea9-33ae-9c13-bcd70d39e52c"},"categories":[17396],"tags":[7124,576886842],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange-multicolor.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3Ai5DiH","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/07\/whats-after-low-code-and-why-should-you-go-public\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187050"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2187050"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187050\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2187059,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2187050\/revisions\/2187059"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2187050&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574370"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2009129"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2187050"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2187050"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2187050"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2187050"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2187050"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2187050"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2187050"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The question for the tech news cycle in China these days has become: Who is Beijing&#8217;s next target? Regulatory clampdowns are common in China&#8217;s tech industry but the breadth of the recent moves has been unprecedented. No major tech giant is exempted and everyone is being attacked from a slightly different angle, but Beijing&#8217;s message is clear: Tech businesses are to align themselves with the interests and objectives of Beijing.<\/p>\n<h2>Education curbs hit tech giants<\/h2>\n<p>The government&#8217;s motivation isn&#8217;t always ideological. It could lead to policies that<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/31\/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech\/\"> rein in the unruly private tutoring sector<\/a> in the hope of easing pressure on students and parents. Recent orders from Beijing have strictly limited after-school tutoring, though they also sparked a wave of sympathy for public school teachers who work at lucrative tutoring centers to compensate for their meager salaries.<\/p>\n<p>The effects of the education crackdown are also trickling down to internet companies. For the past few years, ByteDance had been aggressively<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/29\/bytedance-announces-its-first-gadget-in-a-big-education-push\/\"> building an online education business<\/a> through a hiring and acquisition spree in part to diversify an ad-based video business. Its plan seems to be in shambles as it reportedly plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/bytedance-lay-off-staff-close-businesses-over-china-tutoring-clampdown-sources-2021-08-05\/\">lay off staff in its education department<\/a> following recent the clampdown.<\/p>\n<p>The restraints are also hitting American companies. Duolingo, the language learning app, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-08-05\/china-removes-duolingo-from-app-stores-targeting-u-s-edtech\">was removed from several app stores in China<\/a>. While it&#8217;s not immediately clear whether the action was the result of any policy change, the government recently, along with its restraints on extra-curriculum, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/china\/china-bars-foreign-curriculum-ownership-some-private-schools-2021-05-17\/\">barred foreign curricula in schools from K-9<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Games are opium<\/h2>\n<p>It could be tricky to read the top leaders&#8217; minds because their messages could come through various government departments or state-affiliated media outlets, carrying different weights.<\/p>\n<p>This week, Tencent is in the authorities&#8217; crosshairs. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/tencent-falls-after-china-media-calls-online-gaming-spiritual-opium-2021-08-03\/\">About $60 billion of its market cap<\/a> was wiped after the Economic Information Daily, an economic paper supervised by China&#8217;s major state news agency Xinhua, published an article (which was taken down shortly) describing video games as &#8220;spiritual opium&#8221; and cited the major role Tencent plays in the industry. Shares of Tencent&#8217;s smaller rival NetEase were also battered.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This certainly isn&#8217;t the first time Tencent and the gaming industry overall were slammed by the government for their impact on underage players. Tencent has been working to appease the authorities by introducing protections for young players, for instance, by tightening age checks several times.<\/p>\n<p>Tencent, which has a sprawling online empire of social networks, payments and music on top of games, has also promised to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/07\/tencent-motto-tech-for-good\/\">&#8220;do [more social] good&#8221; through its products<\/a>. And following the recent op-ed from the state paper, Tencent <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/technology-business-china-media-b48e08c16d0c299a970fda6acd7bcc79\">further restricted<\/a> the amount of time and money children can spend inside games. But after all, the company still depends largely on addictive game mechanics that lure players to open loot boxes.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2186395\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2186395\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2186395 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png 1286w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=768,474 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=680,420 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2186395\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tencent share prices over the past six months. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google Finance<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Fix the algorithms<\/h2>\n<p>The other camp of tech companies feeling the heat is those dependent on machine learning algorithms to distribute content. The Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, the country&#8217;s watchdog of public expressions, along with several other government organs, issued an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/politics\/2021-08\/02\/c_1127722893.htm\">advisory<\/a> to &#8220;strengthen the study and guidance of online algorithms and carry out oversight over algorithmic recommendations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The government&#8217;s goal is to assert more control over how algorithmic black boxes affect what information people receive. Shares of Kuaishou, TikTok&#8217;s archrival in China, tanked on the news. Since its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/04\/kuaishou-ipo\/\">blockbuster initial public offering<\/a> in February, Kuaishou&#8217;s stock price has tumbled<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/tiktok-rivals-stock-slides-amid-removal-of-u-s-app-criticism-of-video-platforms-11628166283\"> as much as 70%<\/a>. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based short video firm is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/04\/bytedance-rival-kuaishou-shuts-down-controversial-short-video-app-zynn-in-us\/\">shuttering<\/a> one of its overseas apps called Zynn, which has caused controversy over plagiarism. But its overseas user base is also rapidly growing, crystalizing in<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/23\/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide\/\"> one billion monthly users worldwide<\/a> recently.<\/p>\n<h2>End of &#8220;two-choose-one&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>The week hasn&#8217;t ended. On Friday morning, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/chinas-antitrust-regulator-planning-to-fine-meituan-about-1-billion-11628238951\">reported<\/a> that the country&#8217;s antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Meituan, China&#8217;s major food delivery platform, $1 billion for allegedly abusing its market dominance. In 2020, Meituan <a href=\"http:\/\/meituan.todayir.com\/html\/index.php\">earned 114.8 billion yuan<\/a> or $17.7 billion in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, forcing suppliers to pick sides had been a common practice in China&#8217;s e-commerce world. Alibaba did so by forbidding sellers to list on rivaling platforms, a practice that resulted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/09\/china-gets-serious-about-antitrust-fines-alibaba-2-75b\/\">$2.75 billion antitrust penalty in April<\/a>.

Aeronautics<\/a>, the Israel-based aerospace company behind the world\u2019s first wingless, eco-friendly and compact aircraft fleet designed specifically for dense urban environments.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Nearly everyone knows the pain of sitting in traffic watching valuable minutes tick by. Just as bad is the maddening search for a parking spot, or even just a safe place to hop out of the backseat of an Uber on a dense, buzzing city street.<\/p>\n<p>For emergency medical providers, these headaches can literally mean life or death. Who among us hasn\u2019t stared up at the sky behind a sea of red taillights, wishing we could rise above the gridlock and get to whatever corner of the city in a fraction of the time?<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, flying cars are a reality. The aviation technology exists and early-stage regulatory review is underway in both the <a href=\"https:\/\/evtol.com\/news\/legislation-secure-leadership-advanced-air-mobility-introduced-us-congress\/\">U.S. House and the Senate<\/a> to bring eVTOLs \u2014 electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles \u2014 to market.<\/p>\n<p>What doesn\u2019t exist is a place to land them. The promise of urban air mobility is the promise of superlative convenience \u2014 a trip to the airport that would regularly take 90 minutes door-to-door whittled down to 10. For this promise to be realized, eVTOL landing points must be as accessible as taxi lines \u2014 think a five-minute walk (or one-minute elevator ride) from your office.<\/p>\n<p>And sure, we\u2019ve seen office buildings and hospitals on the outer edges of cities build heliports on their roofs. But the truth is, helicopters\u2019 external rotors make them too noisy and too dangerous to land in tight spaces. Heliports have to be on the outer borders of cities \u2014 they need the extra space for safety (and noise) concerns.<\/p>\n<h2>Urban flight today<\/h2>\n<p>I have over 25 years of experience as a helicopter pilot. I know that urban air travel is nothing new. However, noise ordinances, space constraints and safety measures needed to make commercial helicopter flights viable have largely limited their use.<\/p>\n<p>Existing VTOLs are much better designed for repeated commercial use, but they still don\u2019t solve for noise. Most importantly, they do not eliminate the risks associated with external moving mechanical components and large wingspans.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tInstead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>These VTOLs also require far more space for takeoff and landing \u2014 which means intracity travel won&#8217;t be feasible without massive infrastructure investments, a fact pointed out by countless urban air mobility analysts and even folks at NASA. For it to work, cities would have to turn a huge percentage of their rooftops into miniairports, which would require years of disruption.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"R4GJUiHn9R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/11\/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight\/\">The air taxi market prepares to take flight<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The air taxi market prepares to take flight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/11\/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight\/embed\/#?secret=R4GJUiHn9R\" data-secret=\"R4GJUiHn9R\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That isn\u2019t the only option, though. Engineers are developing compact VTOLs with the agility of a helicopter and the size and relative safety (and interior machinery) of a car. These vehicles have the best chance to prove the viability of VTOLs. Imagine an ambulance arriving at the scene of an accident via air \u2014 landing in a parking-spot-sized space directly next to the accident \u2014 and swiftly moving the injured to a hospital in another part of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day. However, this kind of passenger turnover only works at scale if there are numerous eVTOLs coming and going \u2014 just like a train station. This just isn\u2019t feasible unless most of those eVTOLS are smaller than a passenger van.<\/p>\n<h2>Consider the ground, not just the skyline<\/h2>\n<p>Decades from now, city infrastructure will look very different. Vertiports within the city that can accommodate VTOLs of all sizes and distance capabilities will be commonplace in the modern metropolis. But these train stations for the sky require enormous vision and forward thinking on the part of city planners, civil engineers, policymakers and politicians, as well as citizens demanding alternative forms of transportation.<\/p>\n<p>Current prototypes require dramatic resurfacing of the city\u2019s skyline for safe takeoff and landing at scale, but it does not have to be this way. The street infrastructure required to bring VTOLs to city dwellers is too often overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>Cities need to consider the spaces and cases for VTOLs. We need to think about the city as we know it now \u2014 how can we design a vehicle that fits naturally within the environment that already exists? Is there space to create a vehicle that coexists with the city\u2019s people as well as its birds? One quiet enough that anyone would welcome on their apartment rooftop?<\/p>\n<h2>Big vision, small footprint<\/h2>\n<p>A smaller eVTOL isn\u2019t just more agile and safer in dense spaces, it also allows for more vehicles per square foot, more flights per hour, and more people moved across town per day in a more affordable way.<\/p>\n<p>Before we can build the vertiport of the future, we must first use what already exists today to prove the case for urban air mobility. We need to be deliberate in matching the technology to the infrastructure that city dwellers know and expect, not vice versa. This means an eco-friendly VTOL that can land not just on helipads, piers and parking lots, but literally anywhere an SUV might fit.<\/p>\n<p>Size alone is not enough. We must think about alternative fuel sources. Batteries are one, but they\u2019re also inefficient, and the ecological impact of battery production, storage and disposal make them far from perfect. Some VTOL developers have proposed hydrogen as a fuel source; I welcome this and encourage more investment toward innovation in hydrogen-powered aviation. The larger commercial aviation market is already taking big steps toward hydrogen-fueled airliners, and VTOL developers have no excuse not to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we have to start with a truly efficient VTOL that can have the biggest impact in the shortest time frame, and where time is of the essence: Emergency services. The promise of flying cars to improve people\u2019s lives must be made apparent and available in the most essential of use cases first.<\/p>\n<p>This will not only make an immediate, positive impact, it will also help pave the way for acceptance, infrastructure and large-scale commercialization for VTOLs of every size and use case. Indeed, it will realize the dream of the flying car.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4k1K5tucMv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/29\/craft-aerospaces-novel-take-on-vtol-aircraft-could-upend-local-air-travel\/\">Craft Aerospace&#8217;s novel take on VTOL aircraft could upend local air travel<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Craft Aerospace&#8217;s novel take on VTOL aircraft could upend local air travel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/29\/craft-aerospaces-novel-take-on-vtol-aircraft-could-upend-local-air-travel\/embed\/#?secret=4k1K5tucMv\" data-secret=\"4k1K5tucMv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The truth is, flying cars are a reality.

tricky. The words come easily enough, each measured for its emotional weight in the stream of issues we face. It&#8217;s possible this paragraph will disappear as I find my ground. Mandates, Cuomo, Olympic mental gymnastics, where we were two weeks ago and how it relates to right now. Let&#8217;s triangulate: forget Trump. Forget the Republicans and progressive Democrats who together slow down passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Forget the evasions and half truths, the talking points to fill up the airtime until the actual rubber meets the road.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget the brave athletes who dare to fail for the greater safety of their colleagues. Celebrate the public servants and the difficult personal choices that lead us to honesty, empathy, resolute choices that will draw distinctions between malignant fraud and real outcomes at the ballot box. If politicians refuse to answer questions, draft laws to weed them out of the process itself. Hold the media to the fire they pretend to examine in their choices of coverage, debate, and commercial breaks.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been having an argument about the time delay between recording a show and releasing it here on Techcrunch in a post-produced fashion with music added, Sneak Peeks produced to promote the show, and a post somehow related to the context of the show two or so weeks ago. In generating the text, I&#8217;ve noticed the time delay serves a useful purpose of diluting the realtime urgency of the conversation with what ends up being a healthy dose of context derived from what actually happened. The news is always rendered as the first draft of history, but the constant need for ratings creates this underlying pressure to convert stories from insight to controversial clickbait.<\/p>\n<p>Marshalled through this take-the-foot-off-the-gas filter, the black and white becomes more shades of gray, less subject to the attitudes of the individual Gang members and more attuned to the sense of the group as a whole. Take the perennial struggle between social media giants and antitrust pressure to regulate the worst aspects of the social storm. One side decries attempts to rein in the success of these companies in building audiences and unparalleled power in the marketplace \u2014 a version of &#8220;If it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; The other side says it is indeed broke, and needs to be fixed by breaking up these new monopolies born of user satisfaction with the stream of commentary, sarcasm, and family news. Or perhaps the battle lines are drawn around individual rights versus the collective good, as with the struggle to get COVID under control via vaccination mandates. In the middle between these hard-coded partisan stances is potentially something gentler than being right and more powerful in its sense of compromise.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of mandates, the subject comes up every show. The immediate news may be New York City&#8217;s new rules governing vaccinated access to indoor restaurants, gyms, and entertainment events, but the larger abstraction is the divide between the federal government&#8217;s lack of power to effect a countrywide mandate and the politics of governors in the Red states pushing back on any mandates, most egregiously outlawing local governments from protecting their citizens from the impact of the unvaccinated. Two weeks ago, nothing seemed possible to alleviate any aspect of the crisis. Today, the New York move may encourage more people to act now to protect themselves; the data shows a doubling of new vaccinations in the most impacted states. In turn, the media includes this promising data in their stories, pushing the more partisan memes to the edges of the coverage. The net result is a more flexible narrative that speaks to the old fashioned idea that government can actually get some things done, which in turn helps promote less of the distrust that fuels many of the vaccine hesitant.<\/p>\n<p>Getting back to the new normal drives most of the mandate discussion. The pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of digital transformation seems to reflect a growing understanding that we&#8217;re not going back to post pandemic anytime soon. Instead, there&#8217;s the realization that what we&#8217;re thinking of as survival is a foreshadowing of how we&#8217;ll live both at work and at home. We talk about our creative heroes on the show, many of whom became household names streaming through the stages of public performance and media networks. Streaming has roiled both Hollywood and the news networks, whose business models and value propositions are under attack from the tech social networks. Facebook talks of video now consuming more than 50 percent of time on its network. Amazon&#8217;s advertising revenue is growing rapidly as a counter to Google and Facebook&#8217;s control of the advertising markets. Digital advertising is consuming the linear broadcast Upfronts marketplace.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We talk often about the creator economy, a self-important waving of the media red flag in the face of the mainstream media&#8217;s bull. The Information, a subscription-fueled tech journal, looks like what the newsletter startups Substack and Twitter Revue will look like when or if they grow up. The social audio Clubhouse clones offer a similar promise of escaping the long tail into viable competition for the Fox, CNN, and MSNBCs of the realigning media companies. On each end of the spectrum, the promise of success runs into the overblown reality of too many hours in search of useful differentiation or unrealistic odds of escaping the noisy underbelly of unprofessional media.<\/p>\n<p>If the numbers don&#8217;t seem to add up for the creators, neither do they for the social networks. Once the feature wars settle down, you&#8217;ll see a fragmented array of star writers on Substack and Facebook and very little outlet for influencers and talent to bubble up. Corporate adoption of these tools might prove a growth opportunity for enterprise versions. Is that enough to keep tech in the game? Maybe two weeks from now we&#8217;ll know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/gillmorgang\/issues\/gillmor-gang-newsletter-revue-11-664511\"> Gillmor Gang Newsletter<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">__________________<\/p>\n<p>The Gillmor Gang \u2014 Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.

Then they took another hit. We tackled the topic in the wake of Hippo\u2019s public listing, deciding that most public insurtech companies are wealthy enough in cash terms to not sweat the declines.

CEO on how crowdfunding navigated the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Andy Yang joined<\/span> Indiegogo at a turbulent time. As the crowdfunding platform\u2019s then-CEO stepped aside for personal reasons, the service also reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/5\/22\/18635644\/indiegogo-layoffs-ceo-david-mandelbrot-andy-yang\">grappled with layoffs<\/a>. Coming on board after a stretch with Reddit, the new CEO would have less than a year at the helm before COVID-19 turned the globe upside down.<\/p>\n<p>Now 13 years old, the San Francisco-based site matured alongside the world of online crowdfunding. And, certainly, Indiegogo had a front-row seat for all of the ups and downs. Indiegogo introduced several million-dollar campaigns, but the platform has often suffered from comparisons to Kickstarter, a service that has become synonymous with the category for many.<\/p>\n<p>Yang sat down to discuss how Indiegogo has changed under his tenure, how crowdfunding has evolved and what both will look like in a post-pandemic world.<\/p>\n<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was your primary objective coming on as CEO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was at Reddit doing core product, and when Indiegogo\u2019s board and founders reached out, it was really around, \u201cHey, we would love somebody with product experience, a background in community.\u201d What was going on in Indiegogo was really an evaluation of, \u201cWhat&#8217;s our core values?\u201d When I took the saddle and the reigns, it was really focusing on that core of who we are, what segments do we want to go after, and where do we want to focus. Where do we want to focus our product?<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t&#8220;We\u2019ve had our number of failures on our site, of campaigns that haven&#8217;t fulfilled or just, the campaigns have ghosted their backers, and we own up to that.&#8221;\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>From that perspective, we&#8217;ve been really heads-down for the last two years, just working on ourselves, internally, and focusing on the core &#8212; what we&#8217;re terming \u201cbringing the crowd back in crowdfunding.\u201d I think a lot of the platforms have been very transactional in nature, and so I think backers and consumers and users have been trained by Amazon to click a button and get things two hours later. The premise of crowdfunding is very different.<\/p>\n<p>You may or may not get this perk delivered in the time frame that you&#8217;re expecting, and to help educate backers and the community around that is really core to who we are. We&#8217;ve been through the last two years with COVID, but we&#8217;ve been profitable since I&#8217;ve joined, which is huge. We can control our own destiny and really take the time to do things right and invest in areas like trust and safety, like community, that we really wanted to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The company wasn\u2019t profitable when you joined?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We weren&#8217;t profitable. I enjoyed and then we cut to profitability, or at least kind of a neutral state, and with any kind of change in leadership, some tenured folks opted out, and we basically became a new team overnight to kind of re-found the company, and we&#8217;ve been slowly adding people over the last couple years, but always with that eye on profitability and controlling our own destiny.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beyond people changing roles, what had to happen in order for the company to become profitable?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Really doubling down on making sure that we understood our sales pipeline and making sure that, from a supply perspective, that we had a number of campaigns from across a number of categories. Obviously, our bread and butter is what we call tech and innovation, consumer electronics hardware, but also seeing what other categories that we can lean into. We&#8217;re definitely strong in comics, travel, outdoors, and what can we do from expanding our wedge and our categories in different areas that we&#8217;re seeing growth. I think a trend that we&#8217;re currently seeing is a lot of green tech. Just trying to understand what categories are growing, where our brand resonates with entrepreneurs and backers.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what needed to happen &#8212; just making sure that we had adequate supply on the platform, and also just from the backer side, we had not traditionally focused on the backer side. We had heavily focused on the supply side, but really starting to, again, return back to the crowd in crowdfunding, leaning on my Reddit experience, just making sure that we can engage the community in new and interesting ways.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8216;If you take the leap that the pandemic happened because there&#8217;s just a lot of things happening in the environment, it means we have to build the future that we want.&#8217;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":699688,"featured_media":2186899,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"0a43af90-e3af-3438-8ba4-30f8d246b491"},"categories":[449557102,576602978,17396],"tags":[576667222,576740177,609795,576851304,12358794,344761],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Andy-Yang-Indiegogo.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3CpuYsD","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.29,"featured":true,"subtitle":"Andy Yang discusses life after restructuring and restoring faith in crowdfunding","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[699688],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/06\/indiegogos-ceo-on-how-crowdfunding-navigated-the-pandemic\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2186788"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2186788"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2186788\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2187007,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2186788\/revisions\/2187007"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/699688"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2186788&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/699688"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2186899"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2186788"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2186788"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2186788"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2186788"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2186788"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2186788"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2186788"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":699688,"name":"Brian Heater","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/brian-heater\/","slug":"brian-heater","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eb77d830ad404e16ee7a4c7000b5f49d?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eb77d830ad404e16ee7a4c7000b5f49d?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eb77d830ad404e16ee7a4c7000b5f49d?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bheater","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/brian-heater\/1\/a92\/94","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/brian-heater"},"position":"Hardware Editor","cbDescription":"<p>Brian Heater is the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch.

<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kickstarter\/status\/1422942324049555460\">$6 billion<\/a> to more than 200,000 projects over the course of the crowdfunding site\u2019s history. The milestone comes a little over a year after the platform hit the $5 billion mark.<\/p>\n<p>A matter of weeks before the company hit that last massive round number, however, it revealed starker news. Kickstarter reduced its staff by 39%, through a combination of layoffs and buyouts, as newly minted CEO Aziz Hasan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/13\/21257585\/kickstarter-layoffs-employees-union-negotiations-severance\">noted a 35% drop in new projects.<\/a> The company wasn\u2019t alone, certainly, in suffering major setbacks in the face of a pandemic, but that likely didn\u2019t cushion the blow of a downturn with \u201cno clear sign of rebound,\u201d according to the executive.<\/p>\n<p>With another $1 billion pledge in the intervening 15 months, however, it\u2019s probably safe to say that predictions of crowdfunding\u2019s demise were somewhat premature. Like most of the rest of us, the pandemic has spurred a reprioritization and recentering, and the service that has long been synonymous with the category looked to new methods of engagement.<\/p>\n<p>After a dozen years of being the face of crowdfunding, plenty of question marks still remain. The past decade has seen something of a hype bubble for the process, and for some, the shine has worn off a bit, courtesy of undelivered gifts and unfinished campaigns. What will the next decade hold for crowdfunding&#8217;s biggest name? And will the pandemic fundamentally transform how people back projects on the internet?<\/p>\n<p>We sat down with Hasan to discuss the past year, the company&#8217;s big milestone and the future of crowdfunding.<\/p>\n<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>When you took the role of CEO in 2019, what changes did you feel like you needed to implement?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d really like to touch on the connection that I&#8217;ve always felt with Kickstarter. It, for me personally, is a place where I feel like both my personal passion and what we do on a day-to-day basis came together really well. At one of the first all-hands when I got hired, I said what&#8217;s beautiful about the job that I get to do is that every evening I go home and <a href=\"https:\/\/thecreativeindependent.com\/people\/aziz-hasan-on-finding-harmony-in-your-daily-life-and-creative-work\/\">I illustrate<\/a>. And so I get to feel the hard pain, a lot of the insecurity and the uncertainty that comes with being a creator.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t&#8220;I see crowdfunding as probably one of the best mechanisms to go independently and create the thing that you want and to find the support that you need and the resources that you need.&#8221;\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>I come in every morning and I say, &#8220;OK, how am I going to fix that? What can I do to make that process better, make that easier?&#8221; And so that for me was just this underlying motivation. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning. The thought to me was, \u201cWhat are the ways in which we have the greatest strength in helping creators find the funding that they need?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I think one of the greatest opportunities that I really see is that the backers are such an incredible part of this puzzle, and for us, for the longest time we really focused on the creator tools and really making sure that the creators have a way to share their project. What we&#8217;ve seen is that backers are such a tremendous part of this process and their ability to discover the joy, the fun, the curiosity that they feel through that process is such an important part of the experience as well. And so here&#8217;s a place where we can actually put some focus and some time and attention on what the backer experience looks like. And so that really has been a big mantra for me as we&#8217;ve been moving forward.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean to impact the backer experience? In the past two years, how has the backer experience changed?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One is just making it simpler and easier for backers to find projects that they would care about. And I think us being just a space where this stuff exists, I think just putting it out there as it is on a home page or through the creator that you know isn&#8217;t enough. And so there are a lot of channels that we&#8217;ve been using, particularly thinking about our emails and newsletters and these points of connection that we have with the backer over the course of their journey and actually introducing projects that they might like through that process. So we have a recommendation engine that we&#8217;ve been developing over the last few years that&#8217;s meant to help connect, make better connections based on either affinity, which you might like, or the way that you backed in the past or projects that you might&#8217;ve watched.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early last year, Kickstarter went through a fairly large round of layoffs \u2014 40%, according to reports. How did the company navigate the earliest days of the pandemic and what do you feel you\u2019ve done to help right that ship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What we saw in our platform was that creators just kind of off the bat had the same level of uncertainty everybody else was feeling. We saw a slowdown of projects and what we saw was about 40% of our pledge volume dipping. And as a result, there&#8217;s a lot of projects that fell off as a result of that. There were some very, very concerning times. The big thing that we thought about was, we need to make sure that our business is resilient for the future, make sure that we&#8217;re actually just set up operationally in a way that we can withstand uncertainty as it comes. Through that really tough time and then, kind of peeking out toward the end of 2020, the backers didn&#8217;t change their pattern of behavior. Even though creators were launching fewer projects during that really difficult time, what we saw was that the backers remained extremely eager to keep pushing forward and supporting creative work.<\/p>\n<p>So things like our pledge rates and success rates remained quite high and that&#8217;s especially if you think about the games community, comics, publishing a number of these spaces where we&#8217;ve always seen strong engagement. That engagement actually continued through. About four or five months after that initial dip, we slowly started to see some of the creators come back online, because I think they also started to recognize that the backers are there.
