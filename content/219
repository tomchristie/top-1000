        Francis Goncalves (pictured inset right) suffered the devastating triple loss of his brother Shaul, 40, father, Basil, 73, and mother, Charmagne, 65,(pictured left: The family all together) last month. The 43-year-old, who lives in Cardiff, says all three refused the Covid jab after falling victim to 'anti-vaccination propaganda' and 'misinformation'. Now Francis is pleading with others to avoid 'falling into the trap' of Covid conspiracies. He said: 'They (my family) got caught up in a lot of the anti-vaccination propaganda that's going around. It preys on people who are afraid and they fall into the trap. The message I want to get out is why would the government want to hurt you by giving you a vaccine? What is the purpose behind it? I've spoken to so many people who are terrified of the vaccine and it costs lives.' Francis said that, while his mother had underlying health issues and his father had been in hospital with kidney stones, he was particularly shocked by the death of his brother, who he described as the 'healthiest person' he knew.

      A 50-year-old British woman has been raped while lying unconscious in the street on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca. The woman was attacked around 3am Sunday in the Les Meravelles area, south of the island capital of Palma. Horrified witnesses dragged the attacker away before calling police, who arrested a German man in his 40s a short time afterwards. The man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and taken to a police station for questioning, Diario de Mallorca reported.

            The chaos at Randox drop-off boxes in London was revealed by angry customers (left and centre) who said they didn't dare leave their tests, branding them 'overflowing and insecure'. It came as Britain' competition watchdog launched an investigation into 'rip-off' coronavirus tests for holidaymakers who are being forced to pay 400-plus private testing companies up to £575 for mandatory testing, even when returning from green list countries. Gavin Marshall tweeted one of the photos from Sutton, south-west London and said: 'Forced to pay @RandoxOfficial over the odds for Day 2 PCR test, drive 30 mins to drop off sample because so few collection points only to find it over-flowing and insecure. Covid travel rip off'. After seeing the photo Londoner Tilly Slight replied to Mr Marshall's message with a photo of her own of a rammed Randox drop-off site with the words: 'You think that one's bad?'. Randox provides more than 100 drop-off locations across the UK but yesterday's images have caused outrage amongst experts, MPs and customers, although the company is yet to respond. Travel guru Paul Charles tweeted: 'What's the point of taking a Day 2 PCR test?', adding the photos were 'a symbol of the absolute mess that PCR testing has become. Personal details and samples left for anyone to take, and proof of private labs that aren't in any hurry to turn around the results. Let alone send them for genomic sequencing that Government isn't so interested in now'.

       No10 insisted that the Civil Service was following its plan for a gradual return to work post lockdown amid concern at the economic impact of a fall in commuting in major towns and cities. Unnamed senior ministers last night suggested those who refuse to return to the office should be paid less than those back at their desks, or passed over for promotion. Asked if it was right to take such punitive action, the Prime Minister's official spokesman today told reporters: 'No. We have no plans for that approach.' He added that the PM had made clear 'the benefits of office working' but it was up to individual departments to set their own targets, adding: 'Flexible working is rightly here to stay'. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also took a much more conciliatory tone today, warning against Government 'diktats' and quotas and saying deals should be hammered out between firms and their workers.

            Scientists had expected temperatures to rise by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 but now believe it will happen between this year and 2040. The 1.5C mark is considered to be the point where climate change becomes increasingly dangerous. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change committed countries to limiting warming to 1.5C but they have already risen by 1.2C. Today's report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was produced by 200 scientists from 60 countries. It is the first comprehensive assessment of the science of climate change since 2013 and offers the starkest warning yet about the speed and scale of warming. It comes as record heatwaves, wildfires and floods hit countries around the world.

Pictured: 'Ecological prophets' Chris Packham (left) and Greta Thunberg (top right), and Lord Botham, who has criticised Packham.

            The eight-year-old alpaca stud, from New Zealand but now living in south Gloucestershire, was condemned to death after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB). A warrant was last week issued to destroy the animal following a £50,000 High Court battle, but owner Helen Macdonald (right), 50, claims the skin tests were flawed because Geronimo had been given the vaccine tuberculin which produced a false positive. The alpaca was given a 48-hour reprieve over the weekend amid fears police will force their way into Ms Macdonald's farm early on Monday with a vet to put him to sleep. Volunteers and supporters are now planning to form a human shield around Geronimo's pen to save him - and protesters will today march on Downing Street alongside alpacas to try and save Geronimo from his grisly sentence. The stricken animal has also attracted some unlikely supporters, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's father Stanley among those asking for a last-minute reprieve. But despite pleas to The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to re-test Geronimo, the Government have point-blank refused. Left: A group of supporters at the farm.

            With 250,000 people receiving their A-level results tomorrow, 'snobbishness' from parents is being blamed for forcing record numbers of teenagers to head to university to be saddled with debt when some could be more suited to learning on the job. Last summer's fiasco around grading led to thousands of A-level students having their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, before Ofqual announced a U-turn and allowed teachers to decide leading to rampant grade inflation. MailOnline analysis has found that when taking into the debt accumulated by a degree student and other costs, an apprentice is £52,732 better off on average after three years. And often apprentices will enjoy a starting salary that is higher than the £24,000 average of an arts degree student who has attended a mid-ranking former polytechnic university, especially when compared to apprentices training to be accountants. Apprentices are paid at least the minimum wage throughout their course, meaning even after paying rent and living costs they will make a surplus of £13,292 at the end of their studies. The total is likely to be even higher because many choose to stay at home, saving them £12,000-a-year in rent and living costs such as food and other essentials. In contrast an university student will be £39,440 in debt when their three-year course is done, meaning an apprentice will be £52,732 better off.

            Barack Obama and his guests were seen on Sunday enjoying brunch on a third day of birthday celebrations - after Saturday's big party and Friday night's welcome drinks. The former president, who turned 60 on Wednesday, was surrounded by friends and family on Sunday at Beach Road restaurant. The group brunched outdoors by the water, beneath a marquee erected for the event, and surrounded by flowers.

            Rocco Ritchie - son of Madonna and Guy Ritchie - has starred in his first fashion shoot, wearing Forties and Fifties-style suits (left and right). The 20-year-old (inset with Guy Ritchie), who is studying fine art at Central Saint Martins in London, has been cultivating a decidedly more retro style in recent years, spotted out and about in period suits and outfits. He appears to have picked up his filmmaker father's penchant for tailored suits and his mother's flair for eccentricity.

        The way we travel has changed. Because of the Covid threat, the days of hopping on a plane or boarding a ferry with just our passport have gone, and a new system of regulations is in place.

            ALISON BOSHOFF: As Ant McPartlin promised to have and to hold his second wife (right and inset), his first wife Lisa Armstrong was holding on to their great mutual love - chocolate Labrador Hurley. The dog was bought in 2013 as Ant and Lisa Armstrong struggled, and ultimately failed, to have a baby. They ended up agreeing to share custody for a week at a time each, which is how Lisa was to be seen looking radiantly happy with Hurley - and her new boyfriend James Green (pictured left with Lisa and Hurley)- in a London park yesterday. Lisa, a make-up artist, had been keeping a low profile as Ant married former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett, with Instagram updates suggesting she had been enjoying a weekend away with James at a luxury hotel in Wales.

       Jodie Meschuk has gone viral after she filmed herself licking items at a supermarket in an effort to prove that COVID-19 'isn't a big deal'. She licked several items in the grocery store including her shopping cart, produce bags and the door handle of a beer fridge. Meschuk told her more than 17,000 followers: 'Germs fortify your immune system. Exposure to germs builds defenses against asthma and allergies. Microbes help digestion'. Her other posts address hot-button issues such as the coronavirus, vaccines, racism in America and religion. She also claims that she has a cure for autism.

            Sophie Burdge, 22, from Barry, Wales, pictured main, spent a week on the Balearic Island with a friend following a tough few months during which she lost her partner. But when she recorded a positive test result at the airport on Tuesday before her flight home, she was forced to remain in the country and checked into the Hotel Palma Bellver. She told the BBC her arrival there was delayed by 24 hours, which resulted in staff refusing to feed her because it was after 9pm. Sophie said she wasn't offered any food the next day either and had a McDonald's meal she ordered confiscated because it was processed food. She alleged she then tried ordering a meal from a different company, and said they refused to give that to her either, leaving her 'crying her eyes out' because she was starving. Sophie added that fellow guests have become so desperate they've resorted to making pulley systems out of bedsheets to get supplies to each other, and claimed she'd rather be in prison.

       Broadcaster Nana Akua, London, had a heated clash with former Apprentice candidate Joanna Jarjue (inset) over whether or not it's justifiable to end friendships with the unvaccinated on Good Morning Britain today. GB News presenter Nana said that because she has lupus, she has to take steps to protect herself, but Joanna argued that she has no problem with a fit and healthy person in their 20s deciding not to have the jab.

       Thomas Markle Jr (right) has slammed the Duchess of Sussex (left with Prince Harry) in a trailer for Australia's Big Brother VIP. The 55-year-old from Oregon criticised his half-sister as he entered the Big Brother house in Sydney. In a trailer ahead of the series, the window fitter said: 'I'm Meghan Markle's brother, I'm the biggest brother of them all'. He then added: 'I told Prince Harry, I think she's going to ruin your life. She's very shallow'. Joining Mr Markle inside the VIP house will be Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, former advisor to Donald Trump Omarosa Manigault Newman and Australian Survivor star Luke Toki.

            Princess Eugenie, 31, called Princess Beatrice, 33, 'sensational' in a loving Instagram post marking her birthday yesterday, writing: 'I have loved every minute watching you be brave and true...and you...and now a mummy to be.' (left, right and bottom inset). The mother-of-one, who lives in Windsor with her husband Jack Brooksbank and their son August, also shared a series of throwback pictures in the post, including one of Beatrice with a woolen scarf wrapped around her face while out on a blustery walk (top inset).

            Wayne Earl, 62, became frustrated after forking out thousands repairing damage to his £600k Tudor-style house, a Grade II listed former toll house in Upton Lovell, Wiltshire. Mr Earl's house in the village, where property prices average £600,000, sits on crossroads of the A36 and Manor Road where there have been fatal road traffic collisions. He said that his home had been damaged by lorries and cars reversing at the crossroads and so he put up the light so drivers could 'see his porch'. However, locals complained and police accused Mr Earl of deliberately trying to confuse motorists about the traffic light sequence 'on a junction which had previously seen serious injury and fatal road traffic collisions'.

            In a hilarious online gallery, collated by Nature World Today, unlucky employees from around the world shared tales of very rude customers. Pictured top, L-R; A worker forced to clean spit off a mirror; Someone who was left a penny as a tip; An employee who discovered an old bra abandoned in a changing room. Bottom L-R; A worker forced to clear up a jug of urine; Someone who cleaned up nail varnish spilled on the shelves and an employee who saw two customers ripping up old lettuce leaves and dropping them on the floor.

       Lorenzo Savadori and Dani Pedrosa were involved in a sickening crash at MotoGP's Michelin Grand Prix of Styria - which led to an inferno on the track. The Grand Prix over the weekend was immediately red flagged after the collision between the two riders. Spanish rider Pedrosa stumbled away from the wreckage while his Italian counterpart Savadori, who initially got to his feet, was eventually taken away on a stretcher.

            Hundreds of people and their ponies headed to Balmer Lawn in Brokenhurst, New Forest, on Sunday afternoon for England's biggest horse drive. The Danny Cooper New Forest Drive, a traditional family event running for over 20 years, sees hundreds of riders in the gypsy community make their way across the New Forest in convoy to raise money for charity. The event takes place annually each August, and is an opportunity to people to buy and sell horses. Attendees were seen riding their horses around the fields as well as through the river as admiring onlookers watched on.

            Hollywood loves a carbon copy. From remakes of old movies to rehashed plots in film franchises, the A-list are serious fans of flogging audiences the same thing over and over again. You'd also be forgiven for thinking that a sense of deja vu seeps on to the red carpet, too. Look closely and many celebrities appear to share the very same features. In fact, it's as plain as the nose on their face. From 28-year-old catwalk queen Cara Delevingne (top left) to actresses Emma Stone and Carey Mulligan, via Victoria Beckham and Margot Robbie, there is something startlingly similar about all of these beautiful women's central feature. Perhaps it's no coincidence, for there is a subtle science behind the so-called perfect nose. Pictured: Emma Stone (top middle), Liz Hurley (top second-from-right), Margot Robbie (top right), Victoria Beckham (centre), Holly Willoughby (middle second-from-right), Carey Mulligan (middle right), Lily Collins (bottom left), Olivie Wilde (bottom second-from-left), Brie Larson (bottom middle), Rachel McAdams (bottom second-from-right) and Emma Watson (bottom right).

       In a video shared on Reddit, the employee at a Tesco in Tring, Hertfordshire, can be seen donning a black suit and dark-patterned tie while standing on a small white pedestal and brandishing a walking stick. Completing his somber look with a black face mask, the worker, known only by the username s1mps0n24, stands tall and upright while another man reads out his letter.

            A £4.49 'Dinosaur Print High Cut Tank Bodysuit' made by SHEIN caused hilarity on Facebook page last week as the mums joked about the item's practicality. The body suit from the Chinese fast fashion website has shocked social media users due to its incredibly narrow design on the crotch, with many unsure if they could pull off the look.

       One convicted paedophile, who has been forced to undergo chemical castration, has begged the authorities in Kazakhstan to stop the procedure which will 'affect his health in the future'. The ex-Soviet state has pioneered tough new laws against all men found guilty of child sex offences. Chemical castration is carried out by regular injections, and will continue even after long jail sentences are served. One child rapist has described 'aching so badly' after his first injection that he 'wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy'. He called for the ban of the 'barbaric' procedure.

            Jodie Kidd, 42, (L-R) says that moving from London to her hometown in West Sussex helped her 'curb' her anxiety' after quitting the modelling industry to to protect her mental health. She now lives near Kirkwood with son Indio, nine, and in 2017 purchased her local village pub, The Half Moon, and told the Mirror that after going through some 'very dark times' she's managed to 'get on top of' her anxiety.

            Ruth Shelley, 28, and her partner Robert Oestmann (pictured left to right, together), 27, from Bilston, West Midlands, are a match made in heaven as they both share a passion for living in the past. Not only do they wear old-fashioned clothing, listen to wartime music on their gramophone, and refuse to own a TV, but they have also decorated their home to match the 1930's era and even own a vintage car. Robert, who sells whiskey for a living, is a keen cook who will often experiment with recipes from the 1700s onwards, meanwhile, Ruth, a research historian, praised their vintage lifestyle for having a beneficial impact on their relationship. She explained that they're 'always present' thanks to avoiding the majority of modern technology.

       The dramatic turn of events took center stage at Dodger stadium in LA on Sunday when the fan ran across the field and was chased by at least seven security guards. As the man approached the edge of the field and a fence, all chances of the man being caught seemed to fade as the security guards were unable to catch up to him. But a LA Dodgers ball girl, displaying speed and agility, was the saving grace as she launched herself on the pitch invader and managed to tackle him, causing the crowd to erupt in cheers.

            Kerry Parry, 43, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, pictured left before, opted to have a £380 package deal injection of Botox along with lip and cheek fillers two weeks ago to pick herself up after dealing with a family member's poor health. But she was horrified when she developed a vascular occlusion - where the filler blocks a blood vessel and cuts off the circulation - while undergoing treatment at a salon not far from her home. In a bid to save her lip, Kerry then had the filler dissolved - however she suffered a severe anaphylactic reaction to the dissolving chemical and was rushed to hospital fearing she was 'going to die', leaving her two children without a mother. The mobile hairdresser is now sharing images of how her whole face swelled up and her lips ballooned to 'triple their size' (pictured centre and right) in a bid to warn others to think hard before having lip fillers done.

            The straw-stuffed former Health Secretary (left) is seen with his arms wrapped around a bird-scaring version of his former aide, complete with a large pasty-looking cardboard hand, fingers splayed, resting suggestively on his lover's bottom. The tongue-in-cheek scarecrow was crafted as part of the Eaton Village scarecrow festival in Norwich, Norfolk, which took place between July 17 and 25 and has run for the past 12 years. According to the Eaton Village Residents' Association (EVRA), the Hancock scarecrow was the brainchild of the Atkinson family of Church Lane. It was overwhelmingly voted 'funniest scarecrow' in the village and the family won a voucher for their efforts. The 2021 competition theme was 'discovery', which was 'to celebrate what our scientists and others have achieved over the centuries, and in particular during the past year,' the village's website states. Right: Another entry in the competition titled 'Next Slide Please'.

       The 14 Asian elephants have given birth to two babies, caused more than £760,000 of damage, gone viral for taking a nap, sucked in 400 emergency personnel, some 120 vehicles, and an armada of drones on their odyssey. The herd was spotted in woodland in Yuanjiang county, Yunnan Province, on Saturday, around 125 miles north of their home nature reserve in southern Yunnan. The trunk-swaying convoy got underway in March last year, leaving their long-standing natural habitat to traverse busy highways, city centres and housing estates, in a journey which has stumped scientists. On the way, they have been raiding shops, smashing doors, stealing food, heading into people's homes and even taking a group nap in a widely-shared photo taken earlier this month, which scientists now believe shows how exhausted they are.
